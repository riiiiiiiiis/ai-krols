# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating an existing HTML/CSS/JavaScript NFT grid application to Next.js to improve performance through image optimization while preserving the artistic design and functionality. The current application displays 1000 NFT images in a small grid format with batch loading, infinite scroll, and modal viewing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the NFT grid, I want the images to load quickly and smoothly, so that I can browse the collection without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grid loads THEN the system SHALL display optimized thumbnail versions of images using Next.js Image component
2. WHEN images are displayed in the grid THEN the system SHALL maintain the current small grid size (artistic design requirement)
3. WHEN images load THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading to improve initial page load performance
4. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the system SHALL implement infinite scroll with batch loading of 50 images per batch
5. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the grid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user clicking on an image, I want to see the full-resolution version in a modal, so that I can view the NFT details clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a grid image THEN the system SHALL display the full-resolution image in a modal overlay
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL load the original high-quality image
3. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL allow closing via Escape key, clicking outside the image, or clicking the image itself
4. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL scroll to the top of the page
5. WHEN switching between grid and modal views THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing the grid, I want to see the image numbers and psychiatric terms overlaid on each image, so that I can identify specific NFTs in the collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed in the grid THEN the system SHALL show the image number in the top-left corner
2. WHEN images are displayed in the grid THEN the system SHALL show a random psychiatric term in the bottom-left corner
3. WHEN psychiatric terms are displayed THEN the system SHALL select from a predefined list of 20 terms
4. WHEN overlays are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current styling (font size, color, opacity)
5. WHEN users hover over grid items THEN the system SHALL apply a 1.4x scale transform to the image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built with Next.js and modern React patterns, so that it's maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL use Next.js 14+ with App Router
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
3. WHEN images are processed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Image component with appropriate optimization settings
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current responsive design breakpoints
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be optimized for production with proper build configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the grid to be responsive and maintain its artistic proportions, so that the viewing experience is consistent across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL use the current responsive grid settings
2. WHEN viewed on tablets (768px+) THEN the system SHALL adjust grid columns to minmax(150px, 1fr)
3. WHEN viewed on desktop (1200px+) THEN the system SHALL adjust grid columns to minmax(50px, 1fr)
4. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the 2px grid gap and proper padding
5. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain 1:1 aspect ratio across all device sizes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle the existing 1000+ images efficiently, so that I can browse the entire collection without memory or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling or efficient batch loading
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate thumbnail sizes for grid display
3. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup for off-screen images if necessary
4. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the system SHALL load new batches when within 500px of the bottom
5. WHEN all images are processed THEN the system SHALL handle the complete collection of 1000+ images
